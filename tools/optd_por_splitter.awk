##
# That AWK script de-duplicates combined POR (point of reference) entries
# when Geonames has got the full details for every location type of the
# combined entry. For instance, a 'CA' (city and airport) entry may be split
# into a city and an airport when Geonames knows about those two POR
# individually: they can therefore be distinguished.
#
# In the ../opentraveldata/optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv data file,
# the primary key is made of the IATA code and location type.
# For instance:
#  * ARN-A means the Arlanda airport in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * ARN-R means the Arlanda railway station in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * CDG-A means the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France
#  * PAR-C means the city of Paris, France
#  * NCE-CA means Nice, France, indifferentiating the airport from the city
#  * SFO-A means the San Francisco airport, California, US
#  * SFO-C means the city of San Francisco, California, US
#
# A few examples of IATA location types:
#  * 'C' for city
#  * 'A' for airport
#  * 'CA' for a combination of both
#  * 'H' for heliport
#  * 'R' for railway station
#  * 'B' for bus station,
#  * 'P' for (maritime) port,
#  * 'G' for ground station,
#  * 'O' for off-line point (usually a small city/village or a railway station)
#
# A few examples of Geonames feature codes
# (see http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html):
#  * PPLx:  Populated place (city)
#  * ADMx:  Administrative division (which may be a city in some cases)
#  * LCTY:  Locality (e.g., Sdom)
#  * PCLx:  Political entity (country, e.g., Bahrain, Monaco)
#  * RGNx:  Region
#  * AREA:  Area (e.g., Bloodvein River area)
#  * HMSD:  Homestead (e.g., Roy Hill Station)
#  * ISLx:  Island (e.g., Dalma Island)

#  * BAYx:  Bay (e.g., South Way Bay)
#  * HBRx:  Harbor (e.g., Port Canaveral)
#  * DAM:   Dam (e.g., La Grande-3 Dam)
#  * PANx:  Pan
#  * OAS:   Oasis (e.g., Kufra Oasis)
#  * CMPx:  Camp (e.g., Savuti Rest Camp)
#  * CHN:   Channel/sound (e.g., Greenway sound)
#  * PRK:   Park (e.g., Serengeti National Park)
#  * RESx:  Reserve (e.g., Maasai-Mara National Reserve)
#  * AMUS:  Amusement Park (e.g., Disneyland Park Paris)
#  * CAPE:  Cape (e.g., Cape Eleuthera)
#  * PT:    Point (e.g., Long Point)
#  * PLATx: Plateau (e.g., Truscott-Mungalalu Plateau)
#  * VLC:   Volcano (e.g., Arenal Volcano)
#  * MTx:   Mountain (e.g., Mount Hotham)
