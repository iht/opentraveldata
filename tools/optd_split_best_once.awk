# That AWK script has been run once (June 2012), and is not intended to be
# re-processed. It is left here, just as a sample.
#
# The script aims at splitting single combined POR lines (e.g., with location
# types such as 'CA' or 'AR') into the corresponding distinct POR lines (e.g.,
# a line with 'A' and the other with 'C' as location type). All the other
# fields remain identical (untouched).
#
# Way it was used:
# 
# sed -e "s/^iata\(.\+\)//g" optd_por_public.csv > optd_por_public.csv.woh
# sed -i -e "/^$/d" optd_por_public.csv.woh
# join -t'^' -a 1 -1 2 -2 1 optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv optd_por_public.csv.woh > optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv.tmp
# awk -F'^' -f optd_split_best_once.awk optd_por_cty.csv optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv.tmp > optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv.new
# diff -c optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv.new | less
# \mv -f optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv.new optd_por_best_known_so_far.csv

# Note that, by construction of the por_cty_ref_????????.csv file (filtered in
# by the sequence below), at least two POR (point of reference, e.g., airport,
# heliport, railway station, bus station) serve the city.
#
# Among all the entries for a given city, the entry having the same IATA code
# for the airport and for the city (which has got "CA" for location_type),
# must be split. Indeed, the airport and the city must be distinguised for
# some of their details (e.g, geographical coordinates, PageRank).
